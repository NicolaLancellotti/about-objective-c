/*
 Copying Blocks
 
 As an optimization, block storage starts out on the stackâ€”just like blocks
 themselves do. If the block is copied using Block_copy (or in Objective-C
 when the block is sent a copy), variables are copied to the heap.
 
 When you copy a block, any references to other blocks from within that
 block are copied, if necessary an entire tree may be copied (from the top).
 If you have block variables and you reference a block from within the
 block, that block will be copied.
